/**
 * The time box is a safe-like container with an inside that has no anchor to
 *   the current time, allowing items placed inside to shift back and forth
 *   through time. From the user's perception, opening the safe causes the
 *   inside to present whatever item now exists at that time. items may appear
 *   before they were placed in, or appear a long time after it was placed
 *   within, if the safe is opened and nothing is inside then it is at a state
 *   when all items were removed and nothing was ever put in.

 *	<dd> 
 *	Due to the nature of the timeBox existing seperate to timelines, {@link #load() loading}
 *      with this method will be considered as opening the safe, putting a
 *      card into the safe, and then closing the safe, repeated until all
 *      cards from the save file are exhausted (with each item querying for a
 *      size of a given item). {@link #save() Saving} will strip the size and temporal data
 *      off of the items, thus loading directly after saving is considered as
 *      using a new safe to replace the old safe.
 *  		<br>
 *  Any item placed in will have an absolute timestamp of when it was placed
 *      within, and a relative timestamp to allow for shifts within it's
 *      inner dimensional time. every time the door is opened, all entities
 *      will have their relative timestamp changed as they have now been
 *      observed and must decide at what times does it exist in relation to
 *      the real world (if it lands on a time before the current one, then it
 *      exists in a closed or opened safe of a parrelel world). if the
 *      current time overlaps the relative time + absolute timestamp of a
 *      given item, it may appear within the box for the user to interact
 *      with. several items may appear in the box at once, but each item are
 *      considered uniquely different if they have a different absolute time.
 *      items placed together at the same time are considered as one entity
 *      now, but a given entity may be several items. Each item would still
 *      have their own card, but an entity would exist as a linked list of
 *      cards. an entity may be a single card of a linked list, or several
 *      cards chained together, in an acycled fashion. opening the safe also
 *      breaks the entity up into single cards, breaking up any multitude of
 *      seperate entities. Closing the safe updates the current items that
 *      was inside at the moment of closing so that their absolute time
 *      reflects the new current time (and thus combining those item into a
 *      single entitity within time). This creates a side effect of items
 *      converging temporally together until all items always appear together
 *      simultaneously.  an item's relative timestamp will appear as a span
 *      of an hour, so an overlap (and the subsequent given access) is when
 *      the relative timeshift/timestamp coincides within an hour of the
 *      current time. 
 *      <br>
 *  The only limit to how many items can be placed within the box is based
        only on the "largeness" of an item. you can only close the box if the
        current items within the box does not exceed the safe's spacial
        threshold (if it all fits in the safe, its good). An anomoly can
        occur if several items overlap at a single point in time, where
        opening the box results in the accessable items to exceed the safe's
        threshold; in this case, two random items will converge into a single
        item and being reduced to the size of the largest of the two. this
        convergence will continue until all accessable items are within the
        safe's threshold. The largeness of items will be tagged in the nodes,
        with the nodes always belonging to a given entity.
        <br>
 *  This paragragh will briefly describe the properties and nature of the
        temoral dimension within the safe. Each entity will exist on its own
        temporal timeline, so two seperate entities will be independent in
        their relativeTime shifts. the temporal dimension within the safe is
        also about the number of entities within the safe, about n * 5 hours,
        so that opening the safe usually results in a 1/5 chance of finding
        something within the safe, changing this number will change the
        chances. this gives n*5 hours of time for the items within to shift
        within relatively, as in, even if the absolute time of an item is 20
        hours ago, it's relative time will always land it somewhere in the n*5
        hours boundry (and the center of this boundry is the present time, so
        e.g. 2.5 hours into the past, 2.5 hours into the future, with the
        entitiy appearing in the present if it exists in our safe within .5
        hour of the past or .5 hour of the future). Lore wise, if an item's
        relative shift lands it in the future or the past when the safe door
        is open, it is considered to be true at that time in some given
        universe/dimension, not specifically our universe/dimension. it is
        only in our universe for certain if the time shift lands it in our
        temporally present window of conciousness (which leads to various
        phylosophical ideas about conciousness over time when compared to
        other's perspectives.)
